            This is a database that allows for people to see what games they
            like the most and what games are reccomended for them because of the
            games that they play the most. People can add new games to their
            most played through their account and can be reccomended games if
            they want. This means that the site can be used in two different
            ways, one way is to just doccumet the different games that you play,
            or you can ask the site to recommend you games so that you can find
            new games that you will like to play.
